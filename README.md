# CRX-Lite 2.0
CRX-Lite 2.0 is a novel, simplified approach designed to test my theory of BrainX and the original CRX. This model comprises multiple systems: System 1, System 2, focusing agent, and hearing agent. System 1 is the mind/brain, and System 2 is the body.

> This work is about creating a intelligent thinking model by replicating the brain mechanism. Concept behind this model is from Crx model which was developed from BrainX theory.

## Ring Tree
They are storage units that store the incoming information. Incoming units are encoded upon storage and decoded upon retrieval.
## Brain Regions aka Sensor Systems
These regions receive inputs from the external world, and they contain a ring-tree type of function to store sensor information and pass this information to the storage/System 1 and to other brain regions. These brain regions act as mini-memory storage for their own sensed information. So that when any information is passed by other brain regions or System 1, it will send back similar information that was received by that sensor.
## Dynamic Ring
Each sensor system's output becomes input to other regions, and this transfer is facilitated by the Dynamic Ring. This Dynamic Ring is a system that coordinates the impulse transfer between brain regions and System 1. The Dynamic Ring can also be called System 1/Storage.
## The play
Sensor regions receive the inputs, and they pass the inputs to the Dynamic Ring. This transfer now creates a unique connection between the region and the Dynamic Ring. By this method, brain regions, based on the role they play in receiving an input, become connected with the Dynamic Ring. Not every information requires all sensors to get activated.
And whenever a region gets activated and it passes the input to the Dynamic Ring, this Dynamic Ring will also get inputs from other brain regions, with each creating a unique connection. So that when retrieving the information, the unique connection will activate other regions that were involved in that information processing previously during storage.
## Intelligence
A region sends an output to the Dynamic Ring, which will become input to another region, and this other region's output will become input to other regions. This cascade of communication helps to unfold the memories that were stored within each brain region. The memories or stored information may not always get to the visual system to imagine or get into inner speech (tongue movement) to remember or to know what is happening in the brain. These two systems are capable of showing what the brain is doing, because these systems contain neurons that receive input, which also could be activated from within (as this will also mimic input being actually present in the external world).

Brain regions like visual and auditory give sensed inputs, and they also give information like how the input was received. So when each brain region gives back their stored information about the inputs when asked by the Dynamic Ring, this directs the specific stored information to be retrieved from storage units, and some of the specific, important information may also be retrieved from other brain regions that were useful for the organism to survive.

So if we remove the survival concept from the intelligence definition, we get a clear and simple definition of intelligence: *“Intelligence is the retrieval of stored information that is specific to the situation.”* And if we put emotions or survival into the definition, then: *“a species prioritization of one sensor organ creates a larger proportion of information stored from that sensor alone. This imbalance of information proportion will create a magnet-like influence over other minority stored information, and make the other minority information to work in favor of the larger information proportion. This will create behaviors, habits, eventually a matured, self-centered thought generation that leads to sentient beings."*
## Other important points  
- The ring-tree type should be in each brain region, so that it will return their role played in getting that information. This "role-played" information is like a frequent check-up confirming the information's similarity to the incoming information source; this confirmation is what directs the specific information to be retrieved from the ring tree.
- Each brain region has its storage capacity to store its own sensor-related information. So if it is activated, it would say how it received that input. For example, the auditory region says about the location where it received the input, and the body movement regions say about the body movements/navigation of how they received the inputs. So when all these regions say how they received the inputs, the brain takes all the pieces and tries to map them back into the world, and if found, we understand that information. Human understanding of information is limited to how their brain regions help in order to complete and receive the information. For example, we can remember stories, but not numbers.

(Will share more important information about this model very soon.)
